Build a complete, functional, responsive website for Nesthome — a home-construction platform for independent plot owners in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in India.
Model the structure, layout, and user flow similar to 100Pillars.in, but do NOT show contractor details or profiles.
The primary goal is to collect high-quality leads and let customers understand our process and pricing transparently.
